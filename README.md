# Stupid Aliases for Shellscripting

## Stupid and funny ideas for Shellscripting
These aliases can be put in `.bashrc` or similar configfiles. If your Shell isnt posix-compliant, you might need to adjust the command. Send Mergerequests with suggestions!

## ATTENTION
Aliases in [!Dangerous!](!Dangerous!) will severely Damage or completely KILL your system - sometimes irreversible. Proceed carefully when using them and only use at your own risk. I do not take responsibility for damage to your property as a result of messing with these aliases.
